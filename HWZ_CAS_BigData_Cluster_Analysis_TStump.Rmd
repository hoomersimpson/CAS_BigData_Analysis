## CLUSTER ANALYTICS

HWZ Big Data Anlysis

The following script depicts the cluster analysi
 ased on random genarated data, covering income vs.
ductional lavel (yeary in scool)


## Generate data

```{r cars}
inc1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 10000, sd = 5000)
inc2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 40000, sd = 5000)
inc3 <- rnorm(100, mean = 70000, sd = 5000)
inc <- c(inc1, inc2, inc3)

head(inc)
tail(inc)
summary(inc)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
